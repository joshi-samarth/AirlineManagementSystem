# ✅ Fixed: "No bookings yet" Issue

## Problem Identified

Your application is showing:
- ❌ "Flight not found" error banner (persistent error)
- ✅ "No bookings yet" message (correct)

The issue was that the error was not being cleared when switching tabs or when loading an empty bookings list.

---

## What I Fixed

### 1. **Error Handling** (UserHome.jsx)
- ✅ Clear errors when switching tabs
- ✅ Don't show "No bookings found" error for new users
- ✅ Only show errors for actual API failures

### 2. **Clean UI**
- ✅ "No bookings yet" is now shown without error messages
- ✅ No more "Flight not found" error sticking around

---

## Why "No bookings yet"?

**This is NORMAL behavior!** The user simply hasn't made any bookings yet.

To see bookings in "My Bookings":
1. User must book a flight first
2. Search for flights
3. Complete a booking
4. Then bookings will appear

## How to Test

### Test Account
**Login as user:**
- Email: `john@example.com`
- Password: `John@123`

### Steps to Create a Test Booking

1. **Login** as a user
2. **Search for flights:**

3. **Click "Book Now"** on a flight
4. **Fill passenger details:**
   - Full Name: Test User
   - Age: 25
   - Gender: Male
   - Email: test@example.com
   - Phone: 1234567890

5. **Click "Confirm Booking"**
6. **Go to "My Bookings" tab**
7. **✅ You should now see the booking!**

## Current Status

### Backend API
✅ Working correctly
- `GET /api/flights/my-bookings` returns empty array for users with no bookings
- Proper authentication required
- Returns booking data with flight details

### Frontend Display
✅ Fixed
- No more persistent error messages
- Proper handling of empty booking list
- Clean "No bookings yet" display

---

## If You Still See Errors

### Check Backend Console
Look for errors like:
```
Failed to fetch bookings
Database connection error
Authentication failed
```

### Check Browser Console (F12)
Look for:
- Network errors (red requests)
- API errors (404, 500, etc.)
- Authentication errors

### Check Database
Connect to MySQL and check:
```sql
-- Check if user exists
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE email = 'john@example.com';

-- Check if user has bookings
SELECT * FROM Bookings WHERE userId = (SELECT id FROM Users WHERE email = 'john@example.com');

-- Check if flights exist
SELECT * FROM Flights WHERE departureDate >= CURDATE();
```

## Summary

✅ **Fixed:** Error handling and display
✅ **Normal:** "No bookings yet" for users with no bookings
✅ **Next Step:** Book a flight to see it in "My Bookings"

The application is working correctly! Users just need to book flights to see them in the My Bookings section.
