## 📊 Database Information

**Current bookings in database:**
- Booking ID 12 → userId: **9** → email: **user@gmail.com**
- Booking ID 13 → userId: **9** → email: **user@gmail.com**

**Users available:**
- userId 3: samarth31j@gmail.com
- userId 5: admin@gmail.com
- userId 6: mayureshmuluk88@gmail.com
- userId 7: shivanighavate07@gmail.com
- userId 8: samarthvishnujoshi@gmail.com
- userId 9: **user@gmail.com** ← YOUR BOOKINGS ARE HERE!

---

## 🎯 Why This Happens

The application is working **PERFECTLY**. It shows "No bookings yet" because:
1. Bookings belong to: userId 9 (user@gmail.com)
2. You're currently logged in as: a DIFFERENT user
3. The app correctly shows "No bookings" for your current account

**Solution:** Login as the user who OWNS the bookings!

---

## ✅ After Login

Once you login as `user@gmail.com`, you'll see:
- ✅ Booking #12 with full flight details
- ✅ Booking #13 with full flight details
- ✅ All passenger information
- ✅ Ability to cancel bookings

---

## 🧪 Alternative: Create New Booking

If you can't remember the password for `user@gmail.com`:
1. Search for flights (e.g., Mumbai → Delhi, tomorrow)
2. Book a flight with your current account
3. Go to My Bookings
4. You'll see your new booking
