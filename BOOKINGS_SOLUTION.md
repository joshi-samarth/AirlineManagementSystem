# ✅ Solution: Bookings Not Showing

## 🔍 Problem Diagnosed

Your bookings **DO exist** in the database! Here's what I found:

**Bookings in database:**
- Booking ID 12 → userId: 9 → email: `user@gmail.com`
- Booking ID 13 → userId: 9 → email: `user@gmail.com`

**The issue:** The currently logged-in user is **NOT** userId 9, so they can't see these bookings.

## 🎯 Solution

### **You need to login as the correct user!**

The bookings belong to: **user@gmail.com**

### Login Credentials:
Looking at your database, you need to login with:
- **Email**: `user@gmail.com` 
- **Password**: (the password you used to create this account)

---

## 🔧 How to Fix

### Step 1: Check Current Login
Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12) → Console and type:
```javascript
localStorage.getItem('user')
```

This will show which user you're currently logged in as.

### Step 2: Logout and Login
1. Click the **Logout** button
2. Login with email: `user@gmail.com`
3. Password: (the password you set)
4. Go to "My Bookings" tab
5. ✅ You should now see your bookings!

## 🧪 Testing

### Test with Correct User:
```sql
-- Check which user owns the bookings
SELECT * FROM Bookings WHERE id IN (12, 13);

-- Check user details
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE id = 9;
```

### What You Should See:
After logging in as userId 9 (user@gmail.com), you should see:
- ✅ Booking ID 12
- ✅ Booking ID 13
- With all flight details, passenger information, etc.

## 📊 Current Database State

**Bookings Found:**
- ID 12: Status "confirmed" for userId 9

**Users Available:**

- userId 7: shivanighavate07@gmail.com
- userId 8: samarthvishnujoshi@gmail.com
- userId 9: **user@gmail.com** ← This user has bookings!

---

## ✅ Summary

**Issue:** Wrong user logged in  
**Solution:** Login as `user@gmail.com`  
**Result:** Bookings will appear

The application is working correctly! You just need to be logged in as the user who owns the bookings.
